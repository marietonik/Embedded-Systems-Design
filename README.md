## Hu Moments from Images using OpenMP & MPI
A part of this repository contains the use of OpenMP for parallelizations in a Code specified for Hu Moments calculations. OpenMP is an implementation of multithreading, a method of parallelizing whereby a thread forks a specified number of threads and the system divides a task among them. Bitwise program used for the client's server connection among network.

* The original code does not provide the metrics of the library OpenMP and it is only used for Image processing purposes.

* The code that implements OpenMP parallelizations provides the time of parallelization technique and the Speedup Time.

* The code that implements MPI parallelizations provides the time of parallelization in every rank.

  Relative Directories:

1) Codes.
2) Images.

Images used as input and relative outputs from the codes.

## Extracting Histograms of Images and Metrics using AMD
A part of this repository contains the process of extracting histograms of images and equalizing their variants with statistical methods, while the creator applies various optimization techniques in the original code and measures the efficiency using [AMD Software](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/software).

* The original code is optimized and using AMD software time metrics are studied.

  Relative Directories:

1) Improvision Phase.
2) Memory structure processing phase.
